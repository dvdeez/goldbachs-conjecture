# Goldbachs-Conjecture

Unit: Discrete Structures (CITS2211)

Goldbach's Conjecture: "Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes." ~ Mathematics for Computer Science by Lehman, Leighton & Meyer

Purpose: Simple program that would evaluate Goldbach's conjecture as either true or false if left running long enough.

Credits: Solution methodology inspired by "Definitive General Proof of Goldbach's conjecture" authored by Kenneth Watanabe (2018)
